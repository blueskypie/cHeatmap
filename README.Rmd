cHeatmap is a wrapper of the excellent [`ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()`](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap/reference/Heatmap.html) function with additional functions and more friendly interface for some common 
tasks in my work, thus called the **c**onvenience __Heatmap__. I highly recommend
reading [ComplexHeatmap book](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/index.html)
for more advanced use.

See [manual](https://blueskypie.github.io/cHeatmap/reference/index.html) and  [examples](https://blueskypie.github.io/cHeatmap/articles/cHeatmap-intro.html)

Since this is just a toy, I have no plan to submit it to CRAN. So please install 
from github directly:

`devtools::install_github("blueskypie/cHeatmap")`
