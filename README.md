# cHeatmap

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/devel%20version-0.4.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/blueskypie/cHeatmap) [![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-brightgreen.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable)

cHeatmap is a wrapper of the excellent [`ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()`](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap/reference/Heatmap.html) function with additional functions and more friendly interface for some common tasks in my work, thus called the **c**onvenience **Heatmap**. I highly recommend reading the [ComplexHeatmap book](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/index.html) for more advanced use.

See [manual](https://blueskypie.github.io/cHeatmap/reference/index.html) and [examples](https://blueskypie.github.io/cHeatmap/articles/cHeatmap-intro.html)

Since this is just a toy, I have no plan to submit it to CRAN. So please install from github directly:

`devtools::install_github("blueskypie/cHeatmap")`
